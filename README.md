## Line Follower Bot ðŸš—

### Overview
This project demonstrates a Line Follower Bot, an autonomous robot designed to follow a predefined path using sensor input and real-time feedback. It is a simple yet powerful example of embedded systems and robotics.

### Features
1. **Path Tracking**: Accurately follows a black or white line on a contrasting surface.
2. **Sensor-Based Navigation**: Utilizes IR sensors to detect the line and make precise movements.
3. **Real-Time Decision Making**: Adjusts motor speeds dynamically to stay on the path.
4. **Customizable Design**: Compatible with various microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.) and sensor configurations.
   
### How It Works
1. **Line Detection**: The IR sensors detect the light intensity difference between the line and the surface.
2. **Control Logic**: The bot uses a simple feedback algorithm (e.g., PID control) to adjust its motor speeds.
3. **Motion Control**: The bot moves forward, left, or right based on sensor input to stay aligned with the path.

### Tools and Technologies
1. **Microcontroller**: Arduino/Raspberry Pi (customizable based on hardware preferences).
2. **Sensors**: IR sensors for line detection.
3. **Motors**: DC motors with an H-Bridge motor driver.
4. **Power Supply**: Battery-powered for mobility.

### Applications
1. Autonomous navigation for delivery systems.
2. Educational projects to understand robotics and control systems.
3. Prototypes for industrial automation.

### Setup and Instructions
1. **Assemble the Hardware**: Connect the IR sensors, motor driver, and motors to the microcontroller.
2. **Upload the Code**: Flash the provided code to the microcontroller.
3. **Test and Calibrate**: Adjust sensor thresholds and control parameters for optimal performance.
4. **Run the Bot**: Place the bot on the track and watch it follow the line!

### Future Improvements
1. Adding obstacle detection for enhanced navigation.
2. Implementing a more advanced control algorithm (e.g., PID).
3. Designing a multi-path system with decision-making capabilities.
